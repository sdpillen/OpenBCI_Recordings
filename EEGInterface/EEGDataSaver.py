    This function is called from the BrainAmpInterface.

    A function to be called in a new thread whose sole purpose is to save eeg data to disk.
    :param save_data_file_path: A string - The full file name to save the data (for example './data/subjectX.csv').
    :param queue: The queue to read the data from.
            Data should be placed on the queue in the form:
                index, time, data

                - Index
                    Where index is the packet (or sample) index.  This can be a string or a number.
                - Time
                    Time is the time in which the transferred data was collected.  This is typically from time.time().
                        This can be a string or a number.
                - Data
                    A list of data points in the form [chan 1, chan 2...], where chan X is a number.
                    If data is a list, it will be comma separated.  If data is a string, we'll write it to file as it was provided to us.

            Data save format.
                Data will be saved in the comma separated format:
                    index,time,chan1,chan2,chan3...\n

    :param header: Header for the file.  If no header is wanted, pass None.  Defaults to None.
    :param timeout: If we don't collect any data after timeout seconds, we'll quit all processes.  If none, there won't be a timeout.

    :return: Runs infinitely.  Kill by terminating the thread.
